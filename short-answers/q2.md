# Question
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer
```js
class person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  };
  getNameAge () {
    console.log(`This person's name is ${this.name} and he or she is ${this.age} old.`)
  };
}
class user extends person {
  constructor(name, age, userName) {
    super(name, age);         
    this.userName = userName; 
  };
}

const test = new user ("goto", 1000, "create")
test.getNameAge()
```

Perfect! One nitpick, please capitalize class names! It is a convention!
